   <p class=" text-center font"> Mehndi (Mayon) ceremony typically takes place one or two days prior to the Wedding event. The families of bride and groom gather’s symbolically to place henna on bride & grooms hands. This is the most happening, colorful & joyful event from rest of the wedding events. All the youngsters love this event because mostly dhoom dhadaka & acting performances are a part of this ceremony Elaborated dance sequences and competitions between the bride and groom’s families are also quite common these days . Traditionally, the Mehndi was considered a women’s event and men did not participate in it . However, this has changed substantially in recent times with males featuring prominently in the Mehndi celebrations as well.

    There are many themes for Mehndi ceremony, Bollywood, Truck-Ada & Moroccan are few famous among them. Thematic Panaflex, Cut-outs, backdrops & photo booth are designed for the perfect ambiance. Flower plays the important role wether its a stage or entrance they make the event lively. A colorful farshi is must and it attracts the guest most.</p>

  <h1 class="text-center font">  PERFECT TIPS FOR PERFECT WEDDING</h1>
    
   <p class="text-center font"> The word WEDDING have a world in it for those who play any role in this event. Wedding is not a day, it is an “emotion” of those people who bring two families together for creating a moment to remember last. Our females, they start dreaming about this occasion since they got to know the importance of a Wedding. Our males, in any relation with these female, as a Father, as a Brother or as a becoming husband ultimately wanted to make this event as perfect as she dreamed of it.
    
    To make it perfect, we have two options. First, either do it by our own self or handed it over to the Experts.
    
    In the first option, you have to worry about the event planning because organizers were not their  to manage things for you. It a one pace go initiative; that what you did, you done it. Time or initiative once taken cannot be revert back. Either it will go beyond your expectations (Chances are very less due to no expertise in that relevant field) or below your expectations as there is no median.
    
    In the second option when expert is there, he/she already learned from their mistakes and that’s the thing which makes them stand alone from the masses, they have better opinions, innovative ideas and the most important, they give you a peace of mind. Being a HOST you only have to worry about the dresses and leave rest of the things for us; as we are here to make your event; an ultimate memorial.
